hasing collision is of 2 types
 
1. open hasing(chaining)= data store out of hash table
2. close hasing(open addersing )= data stored in the table in other memory location
     a. linear probing
     b. quadratic probing      (for this watch mysirg.com)
     c. double hasing 


but out of these open hasing is more usefull.because if loaded factor(lambda = no of data/ no of field ) >50%, then searching 
is not efficient.because most of the element store in other places.
